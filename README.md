## Things I've learned about sleep

### Big ideas

I've stumbled upon a couple of one-liners that have deeply impressed me that, though coming from a faith perspective as a Christian, seem to be echoed with different language across much of the sleep literature and media I consume. Maybe these are helpful to you as well:

> He will bring you enough.

Or, as a YouTuber put it, _What you got yesterday was enough_. This is a one-liner I feel like I "heard" from God at the beginning of my sleep journey, and it has been with me ever since. This is just a rephrase of the line in the famous "Our Father" prayer, _Give us today our daily bread_, which is an allusion to when God fed the Israelites in the desert with a mysterious wafer-like substance. This daily provision developed into a larger trope, "the bread that comes from heaven," with the idea being that God is ultimately the source of everything we need, and He always gives us enough, which is of course not more than enough many times!

Translating to sleep, our bodies are deeply wired to get sleep when we need it, and while issues (like anxiety) can push that sleep to the bare minimum, the body still knows what it needs. I can trust that what I got yesterday and tonight is enough.

> Sleep is surrender.

Or, _You can't control sleep_. (A friend suggested this early on and I just now realized how ugly and true it is.) When I say "surrender", I don't mean "what happens will happen and there's nothing I can do about it." There's quite a bit I can do about sleep... except produce sleep when the time comes. The body sleeps when it wants to, and coping strategies to control it are virtually guaranteed to make matters worse.

Consider brainstorming ways that you attempt to "control" sleep (e.g. canceling plans, or spending too much time prepping for bed), then ways that you can actively surrender your expectations for that night!

### Practices

- **Mimic environments in which you tend to nod off during the day** â€” for me, that's in my car after a long walk, wearing a hoodie and joggers. I often use those same cues for bedtime.
- **Find the right hobbies to get you to bedtime.** They should be stimulating enough to keep you from nodding off every 60 seconds (true story), and mindless enough to keep you relaxed. For me personally, consuming media podcasts and reading is pretty ineffective, while hands-on hobbies like origami, puzzles, and solitaire have been fantastic.
- **Live your life as if sleep is not the most important thing.** Find activities and social events to fill in that extra time sleep restriction is giving you. Give your body reasons to enjoy today, and look forward to tomorrow!
- **Learn what sleepiness feels like, and only go to bed when you feel sleepy.** For me, finding that I just nodded off involuntarily is the easiest sign that I'm ready to sleep. I actually find reading and podcasts to be very accurate gauges to "test" that impulse, and thus my level of sleepiness.
- **Give your body a reason to be sleepy.** Avoid catching up on sleep, or conserving energy after bad nights. Any sleep lost today will come back another day because your sleep drive is that much stronger! Trust your body to do the heavy lifting of knocking you out. And yes, exercise _really_ helps, but keep it earlier in the day.
